Logistic regression was performed on a clinical dataset from kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/johnsmith88/heart-disease-dataset). Various techniques such as Lasso regression and feature engineering were performed to select the model with the greatest prediction accuracy when cross-validation was performed.

This was a group project conducted by David Yang, Arman Jahangiri, and Mojtaba Kanani Sarcheshmeh.
